Question,Answer
"I'm a single parent living in England with two children under 16. I've recently started a part-time job, but my income is still quite low. Can I claim Child Benefit, and how might it affect my other benefits?","Yes, you can claim Child Benefit for your children under 16. Child Benefit is not means-tested, so you can claim it regardless of your income. However, if your income (or your partner's, if you have one) exceeds £60,000 per year, you may have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge. Child Benefit can affect other benefits, so it's important to report it when claiming other income-related benefits."
"I'm a reservist in the UK armed forces and I've recently returned from a deployment overseas. I'm struggling with my mental health but I'm not sure where to turn. What support is available to me?","As a reservist who has been deployed, you have several options for mental health support. You can talk to your NHS GP or your unit Medical Officer about a possible referral to the Reserves Mental Health Programme (RMHP). You can also call the Combat Stress/Rethink 24-hour freephone helpline at 0800 138 1619 for emotional support and advice. Additionally, you have access to TogetherAll, a free online support service available 24/7 for all serving personnel, including reservists."
"My partner is a veteran of the UK armed forces and is struggling with their mental health. We live in Scotland. What services are available to us, and how can I support them?","As a veteran's partner in Scotland, you have several options for support. Your partner can access NHS mental health services by registering with a local GP if they haven't already. Help for Heroes Hidden Wounds provides free and confidential support to veterans and their families for issues like anxiety, depression, stress, anger, or alcohol problems. You can also access support from TogetherAll, which provides free, anonymous online mental health support. As a family member, you can use these services to get advice on how to support your partner."
"I'm caring for my elderly mother who receives disability benefits. I spend over 35 hours a week caring for her. Am I eligible for any financial support, and how might it affect my other income?","You may be eligible for Carer's Allowance, which is £81.90 per week if you care for someone at least 35 hours a week and they receive certain disability benefits. However, Carer's Allowance can affect other benefits that you and the person you care for receive. It's taxable if your income is over the Personal Allowance. You may also be eligible for other support such as Council Tax Reduction or Universal Credit. If you live in Scotland, you may also be eligible for Carer's Allowance Supplement."
"I have a child with a disability who is under 16. We live in England. What financial support might we be eligible for to help with the extra costs of care?","You may be eligible for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for children. DLA is available for children under 16 who have difficulties walking or need much more looking after than a child of the same age who doesn't have a disability. The DLA rate is between £28.70 and £184.30 a week, depending on the level of help your child needs. You'll need to meet all the eligibility requirements. This benefit is intended to help with the extra costs of looking after a child with a disability."
"I'm a single parent living in England with two children under 16. I've recently lost my job and I'm struggling to make ends meet. Can I apply for Universal Credit, and how will it affect my Child Benefit?","Yes, you can apply for Universal Credit online or by phone if you're on a low income or out of work. Universal Credit is replacing several benefits, including Child Tax Credit and Income Support. However, it doesn't replace Child Benefit, so you can continue to receive Child Benefit alongside Universal Credit. You should check if you're better off on Universal Credit before applying, as it may affect other benefits you currently receive."
"I'm 18 years old and still in full-time education. My parents have been claiming Child Benefit for me, but I'm about to turn 19. Can they continue to receive it, and what do we need to do?","Your parents can continue to receive Child Benefit for you until you turn 20, as long as you stay in approved education or training. They don't need to do anything special to continue receiving it, but they must report any changes in circumstances to the Child Benefit Office. This includes if you leave education or start paid work for 24 hours or more a week."
"I'm a UK citizen planning to move abroad for work, but I have two children under 16. Will I still be eligible for Child Benefit if I move to another country for my job?","You may be able to get Child Benefit if you go to live in certain countries or if you're a Crown servant. The eligibility depends on the specific country you're moving to and your employment situation. You should contact the Child Benefit Office for more detailed information about your specific case before you move."
"I'm an EU citizen with pre-settled status in the UK, and I have a child. I've just started a new job in the UK. Am I eligible to claim Child Benefit?","Yes, you can claim Child Benefit if you have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme and you're working and earning above the primary threshold for employees paying National Insurance for 3 continuous months. You should apply for Child Benefit and provide evidence of your employment and earnings."
"I'm currently receiving Universal Credit and expecting my first child. How will having a baby affect my Universal Credit claim, and should I also apply for Child Benefit?","You should report your pregnancy and the birth of your child to the Universal Credit office as this is a change in your circumstances. This may increase your Universal Credit payment. You should also apply for Child Benefit separately, as it's not part of Universal Credit. You can claim Child Benefit as soon as you've registered the birth of your child or they come to live with you."
